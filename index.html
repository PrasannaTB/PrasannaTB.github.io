         alt="Self-help book">
    <li>amazon.com</li>
    <p>This book is chiefly about choosing and lining up our priorities in life; what to give a f*ck about and what not to. It talks about how we are responsible for our own emotions, how we interpret situations, and that we are always free to choose the metric by which we measure our experiences.<br>
      Amazing book. Had a good deal of experience reading it.</p>
